### `Simulation_Correlation_miRNA_targets.R`
Simulation of the repression of a miRNA on its mRNA targets for different expression levels of the mRNA, with noise restricted to sampling one. miRNA expression follows a normal distribution with mean =1 and sd =0.1. miRNA repression efficacy was set between 0.2 and 0.002. We have set the mRNA level of expression before repression to obtain an average expression after miRNA repression between -7 and 8 (log2 (RPKM expression)). For each miRNA efficacy and each mRNA mean, we ran 1000 replicates. After repression of mRNAs, we applied a Poisson law on mRNA counts to model the uncertainty due to sampling, and then computed Pearson correlations and corresponding p-values.

Outputs: 
Plot of correlations as a function of mean mRNA expression for different miRNA repression efficacy.
Plot of a targeted mRNA expression as a function of miRNA expression as examples of correlations.
