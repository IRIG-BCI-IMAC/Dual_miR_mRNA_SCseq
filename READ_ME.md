We have set the mRNA level of expression before repression to obtain an average expression after miRNA repression between -7 and 8 (log2 (RPKM expression)). For each miRNA efficacy and each mRNA mean, we ran 1000 replicates. After repression of mRNAs, we applied a Poisson law on mRNA counts to model the uncertainty due to sampling, and then computed Pearson correlations and corresponding p-values.
